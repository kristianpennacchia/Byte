# Byte
An unofficial Twitch app for tvOS built with SwiftUI.

### ðŸ›  Project setup
In order for this project to run and work, it requires you to create a `Secrets.json` file in the 'Shared' directory. This JSON file holds all of the sensitive keys used to login, get followed channels and watch streams. You will have to provide all of this information yourself. The contents of the JSON file should look as follows:

```json
{
    "previewUsername": "TWITCH_USERNAME_FOR_SWIFTUI_PREVIEWS",
    "clientID": {
        "twitch": "KEY_HERE",
        "byte": "KEY_HERE",
    },
    "secret": {
        "byte": "KEY_HERE",
    },
    "oAuthToken": {
        "byteUserAccessToken": "KEY_HERE",
        "byteUserRefreshToken": "KEY_HERE (optional, can be `null`)",
    },
}
```

### How To Get The Above Information

**Twitch Client ID**

This comes from the Twitch network response data and does not change. It is `kimne78kx3ncx6brgo4mv6wki5h1ko`.

**Your App (Byte) Client ID and Secret**

1. Go to https://dev.twitch.tv.
2. Log in with your Twitch account.
3. Go to 'Console'.
4. Go to 'Applications'.
5. Select 'Register Your Application'.
6. Name it whatever you want, mine is "Byte" obviously.
7. The redirect URL should be `https://twitchtokengenerator.com`.
8. The category can be anything. I use 'Browser Extension'.
9. Once you have finished registering your app, the **Client ID** and **Secret** should be displayed to you.

**Your Twitch account OAuth token for your registered application (Byte)**

1. Login to https://twitch.tv.
2. Go to https://twitchtokengenerator.com.
3. Paste in your Client Secret and Client ID from the previous step.
4. Enable the `user:read:follows` permission and optionally the `chat:read` permission (I believe this permission extends the lifetime of the access token).
5. Click the green 'Generate Token!' button.
6. Follow the prompts.
7. Once you have been redirected back to https://twitchtokengenerator.com find the newly generated "ACCESS TOKEN" and "REFRESH TOKEN" and copy them. These are your OAuth tokens.
